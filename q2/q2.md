### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?

I really like working on well designed products, intuitive UX and clean UIs, optimizing responsive experiences across desktop, mobile and tablet.  I've enjoyed smaller teams where I have more responsibility as far as design, UX, UI and API too.  I focus on front end but I'm comfortable across the stack.  The most rewarding projects for me have been the ones that feel like they're progressing, at a good pace with a good efficient team, building well crafted tools.

### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?

Semantic tags: <header>, <footer>, <section>, and <article> They improve the code structure, good for SEO and screen readers.

<audio> and <video> natively embed media in web pages for projects like e-learning platforms and content management systems.

<canvas> - i've used to create data visualizations, charts and graphs, and for implementing custom drawing tools in a few web applications, video startup fuiszmedia for example.

Local Storage - used this to store settings and preferences between sessions, improving user experience. Things like user info, sort orders, UI config states.

### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting innerHTML and using createElement.

With innerHTML, you insert a string of HTML content directly into an element, this is faster to write/build but more dangerous prone to inserting malicious code ( XSS )
createElement, creates DOM elements programmatically, you append children, and build the structure step by step.  
Itâ€™s safer than innerHTML since it doesn't handle raw HTML strings directly. You're changing its attributes one by one. It can lead to more code compared to just parsing the HTML like innerHTML

### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.

Two-way data binding is when inputs update the underlying data model immediately.  It simplifies forms, keeps everything in sync.  Vue / Angular work like this.
One-way data flow is when changes in UI update the state and state then propagated back to the UI, like in React.  This is clearer but leads to requiring extra code to manage all this.

### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?

Asynchronous programming is need to handle slow tasks, API calls, anything that would block the browser rendering.  Actions and data transfer that happen in the background.

HTTP / axios calls work like this, setTimeout, even listeners.
