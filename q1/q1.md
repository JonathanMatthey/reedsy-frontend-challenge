### Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js

My last big vue.js project was for [drawbackwards](https://www.drawbackwards.com/) - a UI/UX Design Firm in Phoenix, Arizona.  


The project views can be seen here: https://jonm.xyz/project/2018/12/01/drawbackwards.html

It was a project for a healtcare client DMEhub, drawbackwards would be designing the UX and UI, passing over mockups that I would slice, build a component library, scss stylesheets in order to render the dashboard, navigation and forms.  There was plenty of state management between each of the steps in order to temporarily store the inputs.  Error validation on inputs, custom number formats, date manipulation and custom input controls.  This was also all responsive.
